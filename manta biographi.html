    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I had been born in a country called "the heart of Africa" named BURUNDI, now classified as the Poorest country on the Planet Earth. But my family has granted me a higher level of education, and now I am a medical doctor. Recently, I completed a 3-year Master's Degree in the field of Gynecology Obstetrics.</p>
    
    <h2>Resume</h2>
    <p>I studied at BURUNDI University and graduated as a Medical Doctor General Practitioner. After completing my medical degree, I pursued a residency program in Gynecology Obstetrics in China.</p>
    
    <p>Now I am in Rwanda to prepare for the interview of the visa lottery green card. By the way, I am trying to secure an internship at hospitals in Kigali. However, they always ask me if I have a local license.</p>
